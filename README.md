# Starclick-Captain by NFB
Prototype Idle-Incremental Game, build in Unity Game Engine with C# Coding.

Playable in browser using the following link: https://nfb.itch.io/starclick-captain-demo

Main features:
 - About 15 minutes of gameplay to get all unlocks.
 - Organic introduction of new UI and gameplay elements as the player progresses.
 - Extensive tooltips to explain all UI elements.
 - Intricately connected systems: every new gameplay element builds on or expands the core game concepts of clicking for power.

Summary:

The idea for this prototype was born from my experience discovering so-called Idle-Incremental games. The classics of the genre are games like Cookie Clicker (https://cookieclicker.com/), Candy box (https://candybox2.github.io/candybox/), and Trimps (https://trimps.github.io/).

The core features of this game type are A) a linear progression curve, where it's not possible to fail or lose progress, and B) the continual introduction of new game mechanics to keep the gameplay fresh.

Having played these games a ton, I found myself dissatisfied with how the introduction of new game mechanics would often completely invalidate old game mechanics: new more efficient production facilities would make older production facilities superfluous and a bad investment of resources. So I wanted to design an Idle-Incremental game where everything is connected: the first production facility you unlock will always remain useful because it is organically connected to the entire system.

In Starclick captain, your first production facility (Ensigns) produces clicks, your second (Engineers) increases the power output of those clicks, and so on in increasingly subtle and intricate ways. The player will want to prioritise spending resources wherever they will be most efficiently put to work, but the earliest production facilities will always remain a viable investment.
